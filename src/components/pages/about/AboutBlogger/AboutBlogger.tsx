              There was once a little corner in my head where inquisity
              conceived. I nurtured that inquisity all through high school and
              until my first year in the university. At the end of my second
              year, it was my due date... &quot;and so the birth of Aima&apos;s
              Corner.&quot; I am primarily a lot of things. I mean where do I
              even start. I am an athlete, a model, an influencer, a tutor,
              sike, Iâ€™m none of those things. The indisputable truth however
              remains that I am these 5 emojis: I am a Christian, a dancer, a
              girl with a nice voice she should use more, a writer and a
              potential actress. Welcome to my lifestyle blog with premium
              content, insightful articles and of course, a place where you can
              get to be you I assure you this blog will definitely be worth your
              time.
